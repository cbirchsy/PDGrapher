# PDGrapher: Examples

Please refer to the next Python scripts for examples:
- [single_fold.py](single_fold.py) demonstrates how to train one model on data with only one train-test split,
- [multiple_folds.py](multiple_folds.py) demonstrates how to train models on data that has k-fold splits. The number of splits is unlimited,


All of the experiments are designed to run from the root of this repository. The [PDGrapher](PDGrapher/) folder here is just a place that collects all of the output of all of the scripts above.
