# PDGrapher: testing

Tests can be either run individually or together from the root directory with `python3 -m unittest discover .`. Some of the tests require data ([test_dataset.py](test_dataset.py), [test_pdgrapher.py](test_pdgrapher.py), and [test_package.py](test_package.py))

Since some tests emulate real world use cases, they may also take a while to complete (~20 minutes).
